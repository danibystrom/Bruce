## About the project

In this project, we individually planned and executed a product from start to finish, applying all the knowledge and skills we've gained throughout our training. The goal was to challenge ourselves, put theories into practice, and create a product that reflects our personal development as front-end developers. By blending creativity with technical expertise, we explored our own ideas and made our unique mark on the project.

The project covered the entire process, from planning and research to development and deployment. We conducted audience analysis, created prototypes, and implemented solutions using modern JavaScript frameworks. Along the way, we focused on key UX/UI design principles and made important technical decisions. The final report documents our process and any challenges we faced along the way.

## Technologies Used

For this project, we used **React.js** to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, making state management and rendering efficient. **Next.js** was chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, ensuring fast load times and improved SEO. To achieve a polished and consistent design, we integrated **Material UI**, offering pre-designed components that ensured a responsive UI. For the backend, **Prisma** was used as an ORM to streamline database queries and migrations, simplifying backend processes.
